# ManageWorkAreaPriorities
RimWorld Mod to enable work priorities by area
Meant to operate in coordiation with [Composite Area Manager](https://github.com/CBornholdt/CompositeAreaManager) to allow fine grained control of pawn work activities.

Motivating use cases
1. Cleaning hospital/kitchen first
2. Planting in remote regions
3. Prioritizing certain zone type work without removing previous designations (a precious mineral strike for instance)
